# Leaf Guard 2018 Robot Controller
This is our 2018 codebase, built on top of OpenRC-turbo (which itself is built on ftc-app) with DogeCV.

There needs to be a class-level `String` named `VUFORIA_KEY` in a class named `VuforiaKeyClass` in the `TeamCode` folder containing the Vuforia API key.

As per right now, the stock build variant does not support instant run, however, the turbo/debug one does.
